# Supabase Desktop

This is an unofficial desktop UI for Supabase projects. It was created for Supabase's [Launch Week 6 hackathon](https://supabase.com/blog/launch-week-6-hackathon), though I ended up getting sick during it and finished late :/.

## Why build it?

I've wanted wanted something like [Postico](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=postico&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&safari_group=7) (which I LOVEðŸ–¤), but with tighter integration for my Supabase projects. I hate having to switch between Postico, my own admin panels, and Supabase browser tabs to do various admin work.

But I'd be lying if I denied that I was also *[nerd sniped](https://xkcd.com/356/)* by [Tauri](https://tauri.app) & Rust. Been wanting to try them both out for a while now & I gotta say, Tauri has been freakin' amazing! Definitely recommend for building desktop/native apps.
